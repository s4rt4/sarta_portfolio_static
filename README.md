# üé® Sarta's Professional Graphic Design Portfolio

This repository contains a heavily customized and feature-rich portfolio website built upon the **[StartBootstrap Creative](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative)** theme. The project serves as a showcase for my work, demonstrating not only high-quality design but also modern front-end stability, performance, and accessibility enhancements.

All core design, structure, and underlying code have been **significantly modified and extended by me** (Sarta) to integrate advanced user features and multilingual capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Enhancements

This portfolio is equipped with custom JavaScript and CSS logic to ensure a dynamic and seamless user experience:

### üåê Multilingual System & Localization (i18n)
* **Dynamic Language Switch:** Seamlessly switch the entire content (text nodes, placeholders, metadata) using JSON files for translation, supporting **12 languages**.
* **Localized UI:** Flags and language labels in the navigation menu are dynamically updated using **Flag Icons CSS** for consistency and clean integration.
* **Flexible Setup:** Supports custom JSON keys for **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** labels, ensuring theme messages are also translated correctly.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Hero Banner Interactivity
* **Custom Typewriter Effect:** The main headline (`header.title`) features a custom-built, lightweight typing animation for a high-impact presentation, isolated from other tagline text.
* **Optimized Rendering:** The typing logic is fully integrated with the language switching mechanism, ensuring the animation immediately begins in the correct language upon loading or language change.

### üåì Accessibility & Theming
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** A persistent toggle button allows users to instantly switch between Light and Dark themes, with preferences saved via `localStorage`.
* **Adaptive Styling:** Custom CSS ensures that all major sections (Navbar, Reviews, Portfolio sections, and Form Inputs) adapt visually to the active theme.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance & UX
* **Scroll-based Counter:** The statistics section (`#stats`) features numerical counters that animate when the user scrolls them into view, providing engaging interaction.
* **Portfolio Dropdown Fix:** Custom JavaScript logic prevents the common Bootstrap bug where clicking a dropdown link inside the mobile *hamburger menu* forces the entire menu to close, ensuring a smooth mobile navigation experience.
* **Custom Typography:** The footer quote and headline tagline use the distinct **Romanesco** font, applied via CSS for unique stylistic emphasis.
